# Inspiration
A few ideas to guide you through the idea submission phase and to get you brain-storming. These were implemented in different hackathons,so ideas along these lines would be awesome!

## 1 - Application Development

* IDEA:
An application that combines multiple APIs such as the weather APIs, maps APIs and SMS APIs to allow people without internet access to still get routes and determine whether there will be heavy rains in the route you take.

* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    * App dev tools (Android/Swift/Hybrid app dev)
    * APIs (Google Maps API, Weather API)

## 2 - Application Development, Machine Learning, Computer Vision

* IDEA:
 An application that uses Computer vision to figure out the calories present in your meal. Also keeps track of your diet and makes smart suggestions.

* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - App dev tools (Android/Swift/Hybrid app dev)
    - Machine Learning tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
    - Computer vision tools (OpenCV, SOD CV)
    - server development tools (flask/django/express.js/firebase)

## 3 - Chatbot, Machine learning

* IDEA:
A chatbot that helps the elderly, suffering with Alzheimer’s disease,  to accomplish their daily tasks by tracking their activity and suggesting tasks to perform throughout the day.

* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - NLP/ Chatbot APIs (api.ai, Alexa SDK, Chatfuel)
    - Machine Learning tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)

## 4 - Machine Learning, Computer vision

* IDEA:
A system that converts sign language to text or even voice, allowing the deaf and mute community to interact with people who do not know sign language, making their daily lives much more easier.

* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Machine Learning tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
    - Computer vision tools (OpenCV, SOD CV, google cloud vision API)

## 5 - Machine Learning, Computer vision

* IDEA:
A system that has to ability to mimic art styles of famous artists to generate art by itself. The System would use GANs and CNN to accomplish the above task.

* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Machine Learning tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
    - Computer vision tools (OpenCV, SOD CV, google cloud vision API)

## 6 - Application development, IoT (Internet of Things)

* IDEA:
A microcontroller integrated smart dumbbell that keeps track of your workout progress by counting your reps and connects to the cloud to help keep track of the time you've spent on your workout.
* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - App dev tools (Android/Swift/Hybrid app dev)
    - server development tools (flask/django/express.js/firebase)
    - Microcontroller+hardware tools (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)

## 7 - IoT, Robotics

* IDEA:
A robot that checks the floors of the building, in the situation of a fire, to see if the floor is strong enough such that the firemen can safely enter the building to carry out their duties. This can considerably reduce the number of causalities in a given situation.
* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Microcontroller+hardware tools (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
    - Sensors (optical sensors, cameras, vibration sensors)
    - server development tools (flask/django/express.js/firebase)

## 8 - IoT, Computer vision

* IDEA:
An IoT Based smart fridge that uses Computer Vision to automatically log in food, informs the users  of what's stored inside and expiration date, and recommend healthier and better use of user's’ current storage through features like checking nutrition and search for recipes related to some items.
* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Computer vision tools (OpenCV, SOD CV, google cloud vision API)
    - server development tools (flask/django/express.js/firebase)
    - Microcontroller+hardware tools (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)

## 9 - Virtual Reality

* IDEA:
A classroom in virtual reality that would help students and teachers connect over the internet in a virtual environment. Has tools a student would generally use in a classroom, like books, stationery, boards, etc. 
* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Game-engine (Unity/Unreal)
    - VR headset / VR supported phone
    - VR development tools (GoogleVR SDK)


## 10 - Augmented Reality

* IDEA:
An application that enhances the educational experience of a student by overlaying 3D models and animations over the images in a textbook, giving the student a better understanding of the concept.
* TECH STACK YOU WOULD USE:
    - Game-engine (Unity/Unreal)
    - AR library (ARToolkit/Vuforia)
    - Graphic design tools (photoshop/Blender)
